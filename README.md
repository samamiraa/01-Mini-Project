# 01-Mini-Project
Week one mini project.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation was my enjoyment for problem solving. The satisfaction you get when you are able to figure out and understand how something works in your code. I built this project to gain clarity on what was learned in class this past week and to reinforce my confidence that I am able to learn how to code. I was able to reverse engineer this in a way where I could add things one by one, trial and error to understand what certain things are. I am a visual learner so seeing what the code is executing really helped what I learned this week.
